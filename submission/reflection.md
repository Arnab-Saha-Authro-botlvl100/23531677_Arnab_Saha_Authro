# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
I used ChatGPT extensively to guide me through Python data visualization, JSON parsing, and matplotlib plotting. It helped me understand how to:

Load and process JSON weather data.
Clean data by handling NaN values and removing outliers.
Customize plots (y-axis limits, figure size, shaded areas, legends).
Save high-resolution graphs in PNG and PDF formats.
Explore NLP techniques for parsing user queries and extracting relevant information from text.

These tools accelerated my learning by providing step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and explanations of best practices.
## Prompting Techniques
I applied several prompting strategies, including:

Step-by-step guidance requests: Asking ChatGPT to provide a sequential approach for loading, cleaning, and plotting data.
Clarification questions: Requesting explanations about specific matplotlib features like figsize, ylim, and shaded areas.
Feature expansion prompts: Asking how to add advanced features such as weekly averages, interactive plots, or outlier detection.
Iterative refinement: Gradually building on previous responses to improve plot quality and functionality.
NLP-specific prompts: Requesting help to structure and parse natural language queries efficiently for automated data extraction.

## What Worked Well?
I’m proud that I successfully created a clean, professional plot of temperature data with min, average, and max values while handling missing and outlier data. The graph was fully labeled, readable, and saved as high-resolution PNG and PDF formats, making it suitable for reporting purposes.
Additionally, exploring NLP techniques allowed me to start building systems that could interpret user questions and extract relevant information automatically, which is promising for future intelligent data tools.

Challenges Faced

The NLP part was difficult to fully understand and implement. I faced challenges in parsing and interpreting user queries correctly.
The graph’s y-axis was looping or scaling incorrectly, which caused excessive plotting time and required careful troubleshooting to fix.

## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would:

Create a dynamic and animated visualization showing temperature changes over time.
Make the plots interactive, allowing users to hover, zoom, and explore the data.
Expand the NLP work to make it more robust and professional, potentially integrating it with real-time data retrieval and intelligent query handling.
Visualize additional weather metrics like humidity, wind speed, or multiple cities for a more comprehensive analysis.

## Final Thoughts
This project reinforced the importance of data cleaning, visualization clarity, and effective prompting strategies. While I faced challenges with NLP and graph scaling, these experiences improved my problem-solving skills. Using AI tools helped me achieve functional results quickly, and given more time, I would enhance the project with animated, interactive visualizations and a professional NLP pipeline, making it more dynamic, practical, and polished.
