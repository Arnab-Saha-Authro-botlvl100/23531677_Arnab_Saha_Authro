ME: What is ollama and how to get ollama key?
  AI: Ollama is an open-source tool and AI orchestration platform that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your own machine (like your laptop or desktop). Instead of relying on cloud services, Ollama runs these AI models offline, giving you full control over your data and improving privacy and security. It supports multiple popular LLMs such as Llama 3 and others, and offers features like easy model management, customization through configuration files, and a developer-friendly CLI interface.
Key Features of Ollama:
Local execution of AI models, no internet required

Full control over your data and privacy

Supports multiple LLMs from an extensive model library

Customization capabilities with mod files and prompt tuning

Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows (experimental)

CLI tools for developer-friendly usage

How to get an Ollama key?
Ollama is primarily designed as an open-source local tool, so it does not require an API key like cloud-based commercial AI services. You install Ollama software on your machine, and you download or pull models locally to run directly. There is no central API or key unless you use optional enterprise or cloud features if/when those become available.

Getting started with Ollama:
Visit the official Ollama website or GitHub page for installation instructions.

Install the Ollama application on your machine.

Use the CLI or GUI to pull available models.

Run models locally and interact with them offline.

If you want a fully cloud-hosted AI service with API keys, Ollama currently focuses on local-first AI, so you'd look instead at providers like OpenAI, Cohere, or similar for key-based APIs.
